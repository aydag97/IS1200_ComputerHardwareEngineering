# IS1200 Computer Hardware Enginnering 

## Course content

The course gives basic knowledge of how a computer functions and is built-up both from a hardware and from a software perspective. 
The practical parts of the course is divided into two main sections: labs and the project

- Labs: the labs are mainly about C-programming and assembler language, I/O system and Processor construction.
- Project: for a detailed expalanation of the project, please check the readme file under the "project > flappy kirby" folder in this repo.

## Learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student shall be able to

- Implement low-level programs in the C programming language and in an assembly language
- Implement low-level programs with input-output, timers, and interrupts
- Analyse processor microarchitectures, with and without a pipeline,
- Analyse memory hierarchies, including cache-structures.
- Compare fundamental concepts about multiprocessor computers.
- Explain and describe technical solutions both orally and in writing.
